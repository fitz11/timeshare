    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the source code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up the Flutter environment
      - name: Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.35.7' # Or a specific version like '3.22.0'
          channel: 'stable'

      # 3. Get Dart dependencies
      - name: Install Flutter dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # 4. Clean previous build artifacts (Good practice)
      - name: Clean Build
        run: flutter clean

      # 5. Install and update CocoaPods (THE CRITICAL STEP)
      - name: Install and Update Pods
        run: |
          cd ios
          pod install --repo-update
        # Note: 'cd ios' is necessary for pod install to run in the correct directory

      # 6. Build the iOS Archive (Use --no-codesign if handling signing later/with Fastlane)
      - name: Build iOS
        run: flutter build ipa --release --no-codesign 
        # You'll need to handle code signing with secrets/certificates for a real deployment
        
      # 7. (Optional) Upload the artifact for manual download or distribution
      - name: Upload IPA artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
